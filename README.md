I am eager to leverage my experience in education and skills in BI to increase educational growth for students, teachers, managers, and businesses.

Currently, I am working with Texas All-State Instrumental Audition data to aid Directors in planning and optimizing instruction for their programs. 🎶

In November 2023, I enrolled in the Business Intelligence Analytics pogram with TripleTen Tech. The curriculum covers advanced spreadsheets, data collection and storage (SQL), business analytics, data visualization with Tableau, storytelling with data (Tableau), and Power BI. 📖

I am open and looking for externship opportunities to further my practice and application of data management and data visualization through storytelling. 🏫

I am a gamer 🎮 and enthusiast for professional sports ⚽🏈🏀⚾, especially if they represent the city of Houston!

My goal for 2024 is to successfully land a job in BI, and spending more time with my family!

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, I hope to work with you!</p>
