I am eager to leverage my experience in education and skills in BI to increase educational growth for students, teachers, managers, and businesses.

With over a decade of experience spanning both the realms of education and finance, I am a dynamic professional specializing in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. My journey began in the vibrant world of music education, where I honed my skills in organization, attention to detail, and the art of storytelling. From there, I seamlessly transitioned into the realm of data analytics, leveraging my expertise to drive impactful insights and solutions.

Proficient in SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI, I thrive on the challenge of transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. Whether it's cohort analysis, report preparation, or implementation management, I approach each task with a meticulous eye for detail and a passion for delivering results. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Music in Education and Saxophone Performance from the University of Houston, alongside a recent Certificate in Business Intelligence Analytics from TripleTen Tech.

As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am eager to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to a role where I can make a meaningful impact through data-driven decision-making. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to continue exploring innovative ways to harness the power of data, driving growth, efficiency, and strategic insights. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to unlock the full potential of data together. 📖

Feb. 24. I am currently on an externship through TripleTen with CrewTracker Software and DataSpeak, cataloging and migrating their SAP Crystal Reports to Microsoft Power BI.

I am open and looking for externship opportunities to further my practice and application of data management and data visualization through storytelling. 🏫

I am a gamer 🎮 and enthusiast for professional sports ⚽🏈🏀⚾, especially if they represent the city of Houston!

My goal for 2024 is to successfully land a job in BI, and spending more time with my family!

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, I hope to work with you!</p>
